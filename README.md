Tech blog is everything you could want in a basic blog site.

Users can create an account, login with their account, post blogs while logged in, comment on any extant blog entry while logged in, and log out.

## Usage Instructions

Seeding the database is awkward, but once the database is created and seeded, this app will do something. You'll need to have a `.env` file in the root directory, filled out with `DB_NAME=`, and `DB_USER=`, and `DB_PASSWORD=`

## Future Development

For better or worse, the time constraints on this project left a lot of room for this.

All the code here so far is merely a template. The core functionality is mostly here already, completion is mostly a matter of renaming a bunch of stuff (varuiables, routes, filenames, etc.) and modifying the database so it makes sense.

Also, the entire front end needs to be addressed. But our `main.handlebars` already looks good, so that shouldn't be too big of a deal.

## Accreditation

This code here is modeled heavily after a in-class project in the curriculum content. It's essentially copied whole cloth. The source of the model is: (/14-MVC/01-Activities/28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main)

I myself have made no meaningfulcontributions to any part of the code.
